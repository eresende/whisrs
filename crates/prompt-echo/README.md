# prompt-echo

Detect Whisper prompt-regurgitation hallucination on silent audio.

## The problem

Whisper-family models (OpenAI `whisper-1`, `gpt-4o-*-transcribe`, and most
Whisper-derived APIs) condition decoding on an optional **prompt** parameter.
When the audio carries no speech, the model has nothing to anchor decoding
to and falls back to its strongest prior — the prompt itself — emitting it
verbatim (or in long contiguous chunks) as the "transcription."

Without filtering, those echoes are typed at the cursor, which for a
multi-hundred-character prompt can take tens of seconds at a configured key
delay.

## The solution

Two conservative heuristics, neither of which false-positives on real speech:

1. **Substring check:** after normalisation (lowercase, strip punctuation,
   collapse whitespace), the entire response is a substring of the prompt.
2. **Word-run check:** the longest contiguous word-run shared between
   response and prompt spans at least 6 words *and* covers at least 70% of
   the response.

Short responses (fewer than 8 normalised characters or 6 words) are never
flagged — they could plausibly be a real utterance that happens to overlap
the prompt's vocabulary.

## Example

```rust
use prompt_echo::is_prompt_echo;

let prompt = "John Doe speaking. Professional, culinary register.";

// Echo detected — the model regurgitated the prompt on silence:
assert!(is_prompt_echo("John Doe speaking. Professional, culinary register.", prompt));

// Real speech not flagged:
assert!(!is_prompt_echo("I'm baking sourdough tonight", prompt));
```

## When NOT to use this

Do **not** use this with streaming backends that do not accept a prompt
parameter. The heuristics assume the API accepts a prompt and that prompt
regurgitation is a known failure mode on silent audio. For prompt-less
backends, false positives from vocabulary overlap are possible (the
heuristics are designed conservatively, but the library's purpose is
prompt-echo detection).
